June 15, 2020

Markowitz, Jonathan N., Suzie Mulesky, Benjamin A.T. Graham, and Christopher J. Fariss. “Productive Pacifists: The Rise of Production-Oriented States and Decline of Territorial Conquest.” *International Studies Quarterly.* Forthcoming.

`ProductivePacifists_Analysis.R` --- R script that reproduces all of the figures and regression tables from the main paper, all of the robustness tests from the appendix, and most of the figures from the appendix. 

`ProductivePacifists_Data.RDATA` --- dataset used to run `ProductivePacifists_Analysis.R`.

In addition to reproducing these figures and tables, we have two additional figures from the appendix (Figures A2 and A4) that require their own datafiles and scripts. 

`FigureA2_Script.R` --- reproduces Figure A2.

`FigureA2_Data.RDATA` --- dataset used to run `FigureA2_Script.R`.

`FigureA4_Script.R` --- reproduces Figure A4.

`3.+Graham_Tucker_IPE_v3_0.RDATA` and `ProductivePacifists_Data.RDATA` --- datasets used to run `FigureA4_Script.R`
